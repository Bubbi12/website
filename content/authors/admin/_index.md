My name is Hjörleifur and I'm a phd student at DTU doing research in statistical modeling and forecast within the energy sector.

After having finished my BSc in Mechatronics, I wanted to focus more on statistical modeling which lead me to DTU where I finish my master in Mathematical Modelling and Computation. I worked along with my studies at Man Diesel and Turbo where I help with the data flow and analysis on the shipping industry. My master thesis was about statistical forecasting in shipbuilding which was also done in collabration with Man Diesel and Turbo. My supervisior was Henrik Madsen which I continued with when I started my phd along with Jan K. Møller and energy forecast and optimization company, <a href="https://enfor.dk/">ENFOR</a>.

Currently, most of my projects are related to the district heating with the focus on heat load forecasting and control of heating system in buildings. I am also proud of a R package, <a href="https://onlineforecasting.org/">onlineforecast</a> that I and fellow members at the Dynamical Systems sections at DTU are behind. The package helps to create recursive least squares regression models which can be used in a online settings for everyone who want to do adaptive forecasting.
